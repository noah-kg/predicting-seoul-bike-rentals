# Predicting Seoul Bike Rentals

In this project I will analyze data related to bike rentals in Seoul, South Korea. My aim is to apply machine learning algorithms to help predict rental counts. On top of that, I hope to create aesthetically pleasing visualizations that help make my findings easier to understand and digest.

## Goals For This Project:
* Import and explore the dataset
* Clean and analyze the data, and create any new or helpful features
* Visualize any interesting patterns or relationships
* Find out what has the biggest effect on bike rentals
* Test several regression models to see which one is the best at predicting the amount of bikes rented.
