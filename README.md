# Predicting Seoul Bike Rentals

In this project I will analyze data related to bike rentals in Seoul, South Korea. My aim is to apply machine learning algorithms to help predict rental counts. On top of that, I hope to create aesthetically pleasing visualizations that help make my findings easier to understand and digest.
